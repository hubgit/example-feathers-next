An example server ([Feathers](http://feathersjs.com/), [MongoDB](http://mongoosejs.com/)) + client ([React](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), via [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)) to demonstrate real-time editing.

Note: there's no authentication, so anyone can read/write to/from the server.
